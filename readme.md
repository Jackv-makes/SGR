# SGR(Simple Gameboy Regulator)
This is a very basic Gameboy Pocket/Color regulator made in KiCad. It supplies 5V and can be used with the modern display kits, but it will not work with the oem display. The reason for the creation of this regulator is to offer an open source Gameboy Pocket/Color regulator that is easy to build.

# Features
- Supplies 5V voltage to Gameboy Pocket/Color
- Easy to build, only needing 6 components
- Removes the need for C32 on the Gameboy Color
- Can be manufactured in any color you like to match your theme
- Open Sourced, so you can do anything you want with it(fun shapes, artwork, etc.)

# Disclaimer
Even though is board was made to be extremely easy, it still does require some basic soldering skill to build and a basic understanding of electronics to test. I am by no means a professional electronics engineer and only do this as a hobby, if you see any improvements that you would like to make; feel free to fork the repo. Please note that this regulator WILL NOT work with the oem display because it does not include the needed voltage lines for it.

Troubleshooting is done at my discretion, the design is simple enough that it will either work or not. I am not responsible for blown fuses, fires, injuries, etc. that may happen if things are done incorrectly.

# Ordering
The board can be ordered at any PCB manufacturer of your choice, if you choose to use PCBWay through my shared project link, I get a small commission. These can be ordered in any thickness and finish. I recommend around 1.2mm thickness and HASL. I've included two gerber files, one with the components on the back of the board(reverse) and one with the components on the front.

# Bill of Materials & Assembly
The board has only 6 components, which are all surface mounted and do require some basic soldering skills to build. If you are not very experienced, you will probably have a harder time with desoldering the existing regulator than soldering this one on. If you don't trust yourself with building one, you can order them assembled from PCBWay/JLC. Don't forget to buy some 2.54mm header pins!
